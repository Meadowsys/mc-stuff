## resource packs

- [Love & Tolerance](https://github.com/love-and-tolerance/love-and-tolerance): resource pack inspired by the visual art style and design of _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_
- [turtlelang](https://github.com/autumnblazey/turtlelang): my stupid little dinky resourcepack that does literally nothing except change things to the way I like, and makes Minecraft (slightly) less playable in the process
